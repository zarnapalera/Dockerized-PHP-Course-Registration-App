# Dockerized-PHP-Course-Registration-App
This project showcases the deployment of a simple web application using Docker containers. The application is a PHP-based course registration form that interacts with a MySQL database. It is built from scratch, creating Docker images specifically for this project rather than using pre-existing ones.
